# OpenIoT Gateway Installation Script

### Purpose of this script ###
The purpose of this project is to support the installation of ic880a based Raspberry PI TTN gateways for the community OpenIoT.

### Credits & Thanks to... ###
Thanks to:
* TTN Zurich - They did a great job with ther gateway setup tutorial and installation script. As a matter of fact a lot has been copied from their routine. This has two reasons: they did a really great job and we would like to have our gateways being set up from the same baseline.
* PiVPN - They have the best setup routine I've seen so fare. Therefore I learned a lot and also copied some code from those guys.
